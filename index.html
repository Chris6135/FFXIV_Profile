                        <p>
                            Kristoff is a large man, even by Highlander Standards, standing at 6 feet and 6 and a half inches. His frame is thick and muscular, built from more than three decades of manual labor and combat. His most notable features are his thick arms, large calloused hands, and muscular shoulders. His shoulders in particular are constantly sore and Kristoff can often be seen rubbing at them or twisting his neck to find some relief.  

                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            
                            Despite his musculature, its clear to see that Kristoff is getting on in years. His hair and beard have grayed to a salt and pepper color, and a map of wrinkles and laugh lines cross his face. A lifetime of violence has left Kristoff’s body scarred, the remnants of many  wounds carving shapes into his hairy chest, back, hips and legs. Three long scars mark his face, the most prominent of which is a long horizontal mark which carves a valley into the side of his nose.
                            
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            
                            While working he is most often seen is his iconic dalamud red full plate armor. The armor above his already grand form cut an imposing silhouette. When in this garb he almost always carries his massive war axe, a blade of truly ridiculous size designed to intimidate as much as lacerate his foes.

                        Kristoff was born in Ala Mhigo, the son of a merchant and seamstress 18 years before it’s fall to Garlemond. After the Empire claimed his homeland Kristoff’s family fled, while Kristoff elected to stay. After 4 years under the imperial yoke he fled to Limsa Loominsa and took up work as a mercenary.                         <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Once In Limsa he spent the better part of seven years serving as a Marauder on pirate and privateer vessels alike. In this time he tracked down his family, who had migrated to Gridana’s shroud. With the rise of the Maelstrom and the fall of piracy he enlisted, seeking an opportunity to strike out against the Garleans.                     </div>

                    <div style="    grid-column-start: 2; grid-column-end: 6;">
                      
                        During the calamity Kristoff lost his family. As the Maelstrom pivoted to a more defense oriented strategy, Kristoff left the organization and took up life as an independent mercenary, hoping for more aggressive action. He floated through several fronts, engaging the Garleans whenever possible.                
                    </div>

                    <div style="    grid-column-start: 2; grid-column-end: 5;">
                      
                        
                        Half a decade of mercenary work tempered Kristoff’s mood. While he never lost his hatred of the Empire, he no longer considered it his life’s mission to retaliate. A series of adventures took him as deep as the coliseums of Ul’dah and as high as the pillars of Ishgard, and everywhere in between.                     <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Now Kristoff is an older man, his past a tapestry of bloodshed and violence and his eyes too old to imagine any future that doesn’t end with a blade. The man continues to fight and struggle until eventually Rhalgr  comes for him.

                        Kristoff was born to Johannes, a merchant specializing in Loomisian crafts, and Marie Gelder, a seamstress. He was a rambunctious child, but not very physical, preferring to spend his time reading fiction and listening to his mother’s singing. With his younger sister Sigberta having taken a shine to art and a natural physicality, his parents assumed he would be a merchant like his father, or maybe a scholar.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        The Gelder family fell into shock when the King was deposed by Garlemond. Johannes managed to secure safe travel to Ul’dah for his family to flee the empire. Kristoff now 16 refused to leave. He and his young compatriots had dreams of resistance. He convinced his father that by staying he might be able to find work in the occupied city and smuggle goods to his family.                     </div>

                    <div style="    grid-column-start: 1; grid-column-end: 5;">

                        Kristoff soon learned there was no room for a native Ala Mhigan scholar in the imperial government and was faced with two options, conscription, or hard labor in the Ala Mhigan mines; he chose the latter.  
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        Deep in the mines Kristoff built contacts with cells of the Ala Mhigan resistance, and worked as a courier slipping messages to other freedom fighters. All the while he used his father’s old merchant contacts to smuggle messages and goods out of the city to keep in contact with his family. 


                    </div>

                    <div style="grid-column-start: 5; grid-column-end: 6; background:black; grid-row-start: 3; grid-row-end:5"> picture here</div>

                    <div style="    grid-column-start: 1; grid-column-end: 5;">
                        After four long years of hard, back breaking labor in the mines, Kristoff’s future looked bleak. His resistance contacts disappeared without warning by the fortnight. What was worse, contact from his family had ceased. Fearing for his family and for his life, Kristoff traded everything he had for an opportunity to escape Ala Mhigo.                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Fortune found him smuggled with cargo that eventually found port in Limsa  Loominsa. A frightened Kristoff walked off the boat, suppressed his native Ala Mhigan accent, and took the first work he could find in the white city. His miner’s physique and desperation made him a natural target for the Marauders; Kristoff picked up the axe and didn’t look back.

                    <div style="    grid-column-start: 1; grid-column-end: 5;">
                        
                        When Kristoff first threw in with the Marauders he was terrified. He was 22 years old, in a foreign nation with no home to speak of and no idea what had happened to his family. His greatest fear was that imperial spies had inundated Limsa Loominsa, just as they had infested Ala Mhigo in the days before the fall.                         <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Kristoff buried his Ala Mhigan past and didn’t dare publicly search for his family. For those early years he was consumed with fear that he would be discovered, deported, and executed. He worked hard to pick up the Loomisian accent, listening to his fellow Marauders and picking up their speech, a habit which persists to this day 18 years later.                         
                        
                    </div>

                    <div style="    grid-column-start: 2; grid-column-end: 6;">
                        As a Marauder Kristoff ran with several pirates and merchants alike. He didn’t take easy to the work, which almost exclusively saw him on boats.  As an Ala Mhigan citizen he had never even seen a lake, on the boat he spent his whole day and night surrounded by an unending expanse of blue. The intense vastness of the ocean only broken up only by the bloody and brutal battles that the young Kristoff found himself fighting as a marauder.                         <br/>
                        <br/>
                        They were hard days, and they likely would have broken Kristoff if not for a Midlander man named Demezel. Demezel was a young sailor on a  merchant vessel Kristoff had been hired to work on. The voyage was soft, and Kristoff had plenty of time to chat with the sailor. He found in Demezel a companion, and for the first time since he had entered Limsa Loominsa, he opened up about his past, and his missing family. Demezel was kind to Kris and understanding, traits of warmth that Kristoff had not felt in almost 7 years,  soon their friendship blossomed into a romance.

                        Kristoff had found a friend and confidant, and for a few short months on that boat all of his cares seemed to be lifted away. One night after the merchant ship had a particularly good haul in trade Demezel revealed himself to a pirate. He approached Kristoff in the dead of night to urge him to turn on the merchant crew when Demezel’s allies came to raid the ship. Motivated by his lover and the promise of opportunity Kristoff agreed.                         <br/>
                        <br/>
                        For the better part of 3 years Kristoff served as an open mercenary, no allegiance to any but the Marauders who had bought his name and taught him to weild and axe. Now for the first time Kristoff had a group, but more importantly, he had a partner. After a bloody mutiny and boarding, Kristoff walked off the merchant ship and onto his new Pirate Vessel; The Swarahl.

                             Even if you didn’t hire him, he’s been in the game for over a decade, its possible he’s worked with (or even against) someone you know.

                        <div> <h5> Gil Talks:</h5>   <p>Kristoff is a mercenary, and in recent years he usually takes contracts that are above board. That said, gil is gil and a man’s got to eat. Kristoff still has a number of benefactors who operate outside of local law. He might take your contract as you follow his one rule: no kids.

My name is Chris and Im a Software engineer who’s taken hard to FFXIV to mov through the pandemic. If you ever want to hit me up feel free to send a /tell, a mog-letter, or just check me out on discord: Manstar#5173
<br/>
<br/>
Im currently on the EST timezone, but my freelance schedule makes me flexible. Kristoff’s history is pretty flexible, so if you are interested in building a character tie and being a part of the story just let me know and we can work something out! 
<br/>
<br/>
This site is still currently a work in progress. If you have any display issues or bugs please contact me and let me know.

                        Important Character Information. 
                        <br/>
        <ul>
<li>I prefer longform storytelling. Paragraphs and multiple /em are not only welcome, but encouraged! </li>

<li>Open to most types of Roleplaying including: Slice of Life, Campaign style, Dungeon Crawl, and MRP. Character conistantcy comes first. Anything is on the table as long as there is a good in character flow. </li>

<li>Respect the line between Ooc/IC. Stories work better with drama, so lets leave the drama in the story!</li>

<li>If you are interested in an RP scenario just shoot me a message, even if I’m not on RP tag, I’ll be happy to plot things out. 

<li>I preffer to handle IC fighting with <a href = "https://ffxiv-roleplayers.com/calendar/event/1543-the-grindstone/" target="_blank"> Grindstone rules</a>, magic permitted.</li>
